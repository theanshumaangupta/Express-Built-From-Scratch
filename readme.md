# Mini Express (Custom Node.js Framework)

This is a small Express-like framework built from scratch using Node.js core modules (`http` and `fs`).  
The purpose of this project is to understand how routing and request handling work internally in frameworks like Express.

This project is meant for learning and experimentation, not for production use.
